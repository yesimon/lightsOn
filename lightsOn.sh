# This script is licensed under GNU GPL version 2.0 or above

# Description: Bash script that prevents the screensaver and display power
# management (DPMS) to be activated when you are watching Flash Videos
# fullscreen on Firefox and Chromium.
# Can detect mplayer, minitube, and VLC when they are fullscreen too.
# Also, screensaver can be prevented when certain specified programs are running.
# lightsOn.sh needs xscreensaver or kscreensaver to work.


# HOW TO USE: Start the script with the number of seconds you want the checks
# for fullscreen to be done. Example:
# "./lightsOn.sh 120 &" will Check every 120 seconds if Mplayer, Minitube
# VLC, Firefox, Chrome or Chromium are fullscreen and delay screensaver and Power Management if so.
# You want the number of seconds to be ~10 seconds less than the time it takes
# your screensaver or Power Management to activate.
# If you don't pass an argument, the checks are done every X seconds.
# Where X is calculated based on your system sleep time, with a minimum of $default_sleep_delay.
#
# An optional array variable exists here to add the names of programs that will delay the screensaver if they're running.
# This can be useful if you want to maintain a view of the program from a distance, like a music playlist for DJing,
# or if the screensaver eats up CPU that chops into any background processes you have running,
# such as realtime music programs like Ardour in MIDI keyboard mode.
# If you use this feature, make sure you use the name of the binary of the program (which may exist, for instance, in /usr/bin).

# DEBUG=0 for no output
# DEBUG=1 for sleep prints
# DEBUG=2 for everything
DEBUG=1

# this is actually the minimum allowed dynamic delay; also the default (if something fails)
default_sleep_delay=50

# Modify these variables if you want this script to detect if Mplayer,
# VLC, Minitube, or Firefox or Chromium Flash Video are Fullscreen and disable
# xscreensaver/kscreensaver and PowerManagement.
